    Dear diary,

    Water runs short. Time is not my ally.
    Implemented user feed posting to large-feed div.
    Implemented signup - push user details into db then carry out same functionality as login.
    Lots of bugs to still work out. Trying to handle http error responses.

    Sincerely, Brian

    Dear diary,

    I feel my sanity slowly slipping.
    Got images and proper date formats working.
    Fixed bug with login/register and getFeed where both were called synchronously accidentally.
    Made test calls on Postman for /post/comment and /post/like
    Cleaned up some of feed formatting

    Sincerely, Brian
